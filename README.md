## Project Steps
###  Part 1 ‚Äì Application Setup & CI Pipeline
- Clone Repo https://github.com/Ankit6098/Todo-List-nodejs 
```bash

```
- Use Your Own MongoDB Database: Update the .env file with My MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- üê≥ Dockerize the application.
  - Write Docker File (image) Syntax
  - Build Docker image with
  ```bash

  ```
  - Ensure that image was built successfully with
  ```bash
  docker images || docker image ls
  ```
  - Run Container using created image with 
  ```bash
  docker run --name (container_name) -d -p 4000:4000 (image_name)
  ```
  - show running container with 
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
  - Ensure app running and Dockerized successfully with logs 
  ```bash
  docker logs (container_name)
  ```
